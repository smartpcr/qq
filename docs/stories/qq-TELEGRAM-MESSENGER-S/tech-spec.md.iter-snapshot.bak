# Technical Specification — Telegram Messenger Support

**Story:** `qq:TELEGRAM-MESSENGER-S` · 13 SP
**Status:** Draft — Iteration 11
**Last updated:** 2026-05-11

---

## 1  Problem Statement

The agent swarm (100+ autonomous agents performing planning, coding, testing, release, and incident response) currently has no human-facing communication channel. Operators need a mobile-first interface to issue commands, answer blocking agent questions, approve or reject proposed actions, and receive urgent alerts — all from a phone.

This story delivers a **Telegram Bot connector** that plugs into the Messenger Gateway architecture described in the story attachment (`.forge-attachments/agent_swarm_messenger_user_stories.md`). The connector implements `IMessengerConnector`, speaks the Telegram Bot API over HTTPS, and integrates with the shared data model (`AgentQuestion`, `HumanAction`, `HumanDecisionEvent`).

The system must handle bursty traffic from 100+ concurrent agents without message loss, deduplicate webhook replays, and maintain a full audit trail with correlation IDs.

---

## 2  In-Scope

| # | Area | Detail |
|---|------|--------|
| S-1 | **Telegram Bot API integration** | HTTPS transport via `Telegram.Bot` NuGet package. Webhook receive in production; long-polling receive in dev/local. |
| S-2 | **Command handling** | `/start`, `/status`, `/agents`, `/ask`, `/approve`, `/reject`, `/handoff`, `/pause`, `/resume` — parsed, validated, and dispatched to the Agent Swarm Orchestrator. `/handoff TASK-ID @operator-alias` performs a full oversight transfer: validates task existence and current oversight, resolves the target operator via `OperatorRegistry`, updates the `OperatorBinding`, notifies both operators, and persists an audit record (see D-4 §7). |
| S-3 | **Agent-to-human questions** | Render `AgentQuestion` as Telegram messages with inline keyboard buttons for each `HumanAction`. Include context, severity, timeout, and proposed default action in the message body. The shared `AgentQuestion` carries a nullable `DefaultAction` property (`string?`, a `HumanAction.ActionId`) per architecture.md §3.1 (lines 166–181). At render time the Telegram connector copies `AgentQuestion.DefaultAction` into `PendingQuestionRecord.DefaultActionId` for efficient timeout polling (see HC-3). |
| S-4 | **Strongly typed decision events** | Button taps and text replies are converted to `HumanDecisionEvent` and published to the orchestrator. |
| S-5 | **Operator identity mapping** | Map Telegram `chat_id` + `user_id` to an authorized operator record with tenant/workspace binding. Reject unmapped users. Applies in both 1:1 and group-chat contexts — commands in groups are attributed to the sending `user_id`, not the group `chat_id`. |
| S-6 | **Durable outbound queue** | Persistent queue (outbox pattern) with retry, exponential back-off, deduplication, and dead-letter queue for Telegram API sends. |
| S-7 | **Webhook idempotency** | Deduplicate inbound webhook deliveries by `update_id` to prevent double command execution. |
| S-8 | **Secret management** | Bot token retrieved from Azure Key Vault (or Kubernetes secret / DPAPI in dev). Token never logged or serialized to telemetry. |
| S-9 | **Audit logging** | Every human response persisted with: `message_id`, `user_id`, `agent_id`, `timestamp`, `correlation_id`. |
| S-10 | **Observability** | OpenTelemetry traces and metrics; structured logging; health-check endpoint for the connector. |
| S-11 | **Rich formatting** | Markdown message bodies, inline buttons, reply correlation, deep links where the Telegram API supports them. |

## 3  Out of Scope

| # | Item | Rationale |
|---|------|-----------|
| O-1 | Discord, Slack, Teams connectors | Separate stories in the Messenger Gateway epic; this story covers only the Telegram connector. |
| O-2 | Connector-agnostic orchestration logic | The Worker Service host (`AgentSwarm.Messaging.Worker`) **is in scope** — it is created by this story (implementation-plan.md Stage 1.1) as the container for the Telegram connector. What is out of scope is any connector-agnostic routing, multi-connector dispatch, or orchestration logic beyond what the Telegram adapter itself requires. |
| O-3 | Agent Swarm Orchestrator internals | We consume its API surface; we do not modify it. |
| O-4 | Bot registration / BotFather setup | Operational runbook, not code. Document the required steps in a companion ops guide. |
| O-5 | Group-chat moderation features | V1 supports basic group-chat operation (allowlist enforcement per `user_id`, command attribution to the sending operator, unauthorized-button rejection) as defined in e2e-scenarios.md. Full group-moderation features (thread management, role-based visibility, per-group notification preferences) are follow-on. |
| O-6 | Media attachments (images, files) | Text and inline-button interactions only in V1. |
| O-7 | Telegram Payments or inline-query mode | Not relevant to operator workflows. |
| O-8 | Custom Telegram Bot API server (tdlib) | We use the official cloud Bot API endpoint. |

---

## 4  Non-Goals

1. **Real-time streaming / WebSocket push to Telegram.** Telegram Bot API is request/response; we do not attempt to work around this.
2. **Multi-language / i18n for bot messages.** English-only for V1; localization is a future epic.
3. **Replacing the orchestrator's internal event bus.** The Telegram connector is a leaf adapter; it does not become a message broker.
4. **Mobile app beyond Telegram.** No custom app; we rely on the Telegram client.

---

## 5  Hard Constraints

| ID | Constraint | Source |
|----|-----------|--------|
| HC-1 | Implementation language: **C# / .NET 8+** | Epic requirement |
| HC-2 | Must implement `IMessengerConnector` from `AgentSwarm.Messaging.Abstractions` | Epic shared interface (FR-001) |
| HC-3 | Must use the shared data model: `AgentQuestion`, `HumanAction`, `HumanDecisionEvent`. The story requires "proposed default action" handling. Per **architecture.md §3.1** (lines 166–181, authoritative for the shared model), the shared `AgentQuestion` **includes** a nullable `DefaultAction` property (`string?`) — the `HumanAction.ActionId` of the proposed default action to apply on timeout. When `DefaultAction` is `null`, no automatic decision is applied on timeout and the question expires with `ActionValue = "__timeout__"`. The full `AgentQuestion` properties are: `QuestionId`, `AgentId`, `TaskId`, `Title`, `Body`, `Severity`, `AllowedActions`, `ExpiresAt`, `DefaultAction`, and `CorrelationId`. At render time the Telegram connector **denormalizes** `AgentQuestion.DefaultAction` into `PendingQuestionRecord.DefaultActionId` for efficient timeout polling (architecture.md §3.1 line 194). The `QuestionTimeoutService` reads `PendingQuestionRecord.DefaultActionId` at expiry: if present, it resolves the full `HumanAction` from `IDistributedCache` and publishes a `HumanDecisionEvent`; if absent (`null`), it publishes a timeout event with `ActionValue = "__timeout__"`. **Cross-doc note:** implementation-plan.md Stage 1.2 (line 36) currently states the shared `AgentQuestion` does NOT include `DefaultAction` — this contradicts architecture.md §3.1 (lines 168, 180) which explicitly includes it. This spec aligns with architecture.md as the authoritative source for shared model definitions; implementation-plan.md should reconcile by adding `DefaultAction` to the `AgentQuestion` property list. | Story requirement + architecture.md §3.1 (authoritative for shared model) |
| HC-4 | P95 outbound send latency **< 2 seconds** after event is queued | Story requirement (tighter than epic's 3 s) |
| HC-5 | **Zero message loss** for Critical, High, and Normal severity messages under burst from 100+ agents (1 000+ queued events). Under extreme backpressure (queue depth exceeds `MaxQueueDepth`, default 5 000), **only Low-severity** messages that cannot be enqueued are immediately **dead-lettered** — not silently discarded, not shed. Dead-lettered messages are persisted in the dead-letter queue with full failure context, counted via a `telegram.messages.deadlettered_backpressure` metric, and trigger an ops-channel alert. Operators can replay dead-lettered messages from the DLQ once pressure subsides. This is consistent with architecture.md §10.4's priority-queuing design and the reliability model's "delivered-or-dead-lettered" contract. Critical, High, and Normal severity messages are never subject to backpressure rejection — they are always enqueued regardless of queue depth, consistent with architecture.md §10.4 which states "`Normal`, `High`, and `Critical` severity messages are always accepted." | Story + epic performance requirements + architecture.md §10.4 |
| HC-6 | Bot token stored in **Key Vault or equivalent**; never logged | Story security requirement |
| HC-7 | Webhook secret validation using Telegram's `X-Telegram-Bot-Api-Secret-Token` header | Telegram Bot API best practice + story security |
| HC-8 | Idempotent inbound processing — duplicate `update_id` must not re-execute commands | Story AC-003 |
| HC-9 | All messages carry `CorrelationId`, `AgentId`, `TaskId`, `ConversationId`, `Timestamp` | Epic FR-004 |
| HC-10 | Connector must recover from restart within **30 seconds** | Epic FR-007 |
| HC-11 | NuGet dependency: prefer `Telegram.Bot`; fall back to `Telegram.BotAPI` only if Bot API surface coverage is required | Story library preference |

## 6  Identified Risks

### 6.1  Technical Risks

| ID | Risk | Likelihood | Impact | Mitigation |
|----|------|-----------|--------|------------|
| R-1 | **Telegram Bot API rate limits** — `sendMessage` is limited to ~30 msg/s globally per bot and ~20 msg/min per individual chat (per architecture.md's rate-limiter design). Under 100-agent burst, we may hit 429 errors. | High | High | Implement a dual token-bucket rate limiter in the outbound queue: one global bucket (30 msg/s) and per-chat buckets (20 msg/min). Back-off on 429 with `retry_after`. Spread alerts across operator chats when possible. |
| R-2 | **Webhook endpoint availability** — If the ASP.NET host is behind a load balancer restart or deployment, Telegram may fail to deliver updates and retry for a limited window. | Medium | Medium | Register webhook with `max_connections` tuned to replica count. Implement `/setWebhook` on startup with `drop_pending_updates=false`. For blue/green deploys, keep old pod alive until new webhook is confirmed. |
| R-3 | **Inline keyboard callback data limit** — Telegram limits `callback_data` to 64 bytes. Complex `HumanAction` payloads won't fit. | High | Medium | Encode `QuestionId:ActionId` in `callback_data` (aligned with architecture.md). `ActionId` is a short key; the full `HumanAction` payload is stored server-side in `IDistributedCache` keyed by `QuestionId:ActionId`, with entries expiring at `AgentQuestion.ExpiresAt`. On callback, the handler looks up the cache entry to resolve the chosen action. This keeps `callback_data` well within the 64-byte limit. |
| R-4 | **Long-polling ↔ webhook mode switching** — Telegram does not allow both simultaneously; switching requires calling `deleteWebhook` first. | Low | Low | Configuration-driven mode selection at startup. Guard with a startup check that calls `deleteWebhook` before starting long-polling and `setWebhook` before starting webhook mode. |
| R-5 | **Secret rotation** — If the Key Vault token is rotated while the connector is running, the bot loses API access until restart. | Medium | High | Use Key Vault SDK's `SecretClient` with `CacheControl` / periodic refresh (e.g., every 5 minutes via `IOptionsMonitor<T>` reload). |
| R-6 | **Outbox queue durability** — If the outbox is in-process only (e.g., `Channel<T>`), a process crash loses queued messages. | Medium | High | Use a durable store (database outbox table or external queue like Azure Service Bus) for the outbound queue. In-process channel serves only as a hot buffer in front of the durable store. |
| R-7 | **Update ID gap detection** — Telegram guarantees sequential `update_id` but may skip IDs. Deduplication must not treat gaps as missing messages. | Low | Medium | Deduplicate by storing processed `update_id` values in a sliding window (e.g., last 10 000 IDs) rather than relying on strict sequence. |

### 6.2  Operational Risks

| ID | Risk | Likelihood | Impact | Mitigation |
|----|------|-----------|--------|------------|
| R-8 | **Operator loses phone / Telegram account compromised** — Attacker could issue `/approve` commands. | Low | Critical | Allowlist validation is necessary but not sufficient. Add optional 2FA challenge for high-severity approvals (e.g., require a confirmation code from a second channel). Log all commands with full audit trail for forensic review. |
| R-9 | **Telegram platform outage** — Extended downtime prevents operators from responding to blocking questions. | Low | High | `AgentQuestion.ExpiresAt` triggers the proposed default action if no human response is received. Alert operators via a secondary channel (email / PagerDuty) if Telegram send fails after all retries. |
| R-10 | **Regulatory / data-residency** — Telegram servers are outside the operator's jurisdiction; message content may include sensitive project names. | Medium | Medium | Do not send source code or secrets in Telegram messages. Limit message content to task summaries, question text, and action labels. Document data-classification policy for Telegram message content. |

### 6.3  Dependency Risks

| ID | Risk | Likelihood | Impact | Mitigation |
|----|------|-----------|--------|------------|
| R-11 | **`Telegram.Bot` NuGet package breaking changes** — Major version bumps have historically changed the API surface significantly. | Medium | Medium | Pin to a specific major version in the `.csproj`. Wrap all Telegram SDK calls behind an internal `ITelegramClientWrapper` so upgrades are localized. |
| R-12 | **Shared abstractions not yet stable** — `IMessengerConnector` and the shared data model may evolve as Discord/Slack/Teams stories proceed in parallel. | High | Medium | Code against the interface as defined in the epic attachment. Flag any required interface changes as cross-story coordination items in the iteration summary. |

## 7  Key Decisions Required

| # | Decision | Options | Recommendation | Status |
|---|----------|---------|----------------|--------|
| D-1 | Durable outbox backing store | (a) Database table (EF Core), (b) Azure Service Bus, (c) In-process only | **(a) Database table via EF Core** — no external queue dependency. **SQLite for dev/local environments; PostgreSQL or SQL Server for production** — consistent with implementation-plan.md (Stages 4.1, 4.3, 5.1, 5.3) which specifies "SQLite for dev/local, PostgreSQL or SQL Server for production" for outbox, dead-letter, deduplication, and audit stores. Architecture.md (§11.3) frames the production provider as a deployment decision, which is compatible: the EF Core abstraction makes the provider a configuration swap, not a schema change. | Decided |
| D-2 | Deduplication store for `update_id` | (a) In-memory concurrent dictionary with TTL, (b) Database table, (c) Redis | **(a) In-memory** for single-instance dev, **(b) Database** for multi-instance prod. Configuration-driven. | Proposed |
| D-3 | Callback data encoding for inline buttons | (a) Direct `QuestionId:ActionId` in `callback_data` with server-side `HumanAction` lookup, (b) Full payload encoding in `callback_data` | **(a) `QuestionId:ActionId` with `IDistributedCache` lookup** — aligned with architecture.md. `ActionId` is a short key; the full `HumanAction` is stored server-side in `IDistributedCache` keyed by `QuestionId:ActionId`, written when the inline keyboard is built and expiring at `AgentQuestion.ExpiresAt`. This keeps `callback_data` well within Telegram's 64-byte limit. | Decided |
| D-4 | `/handoff` command semantics | (a) Transfer human oversight of a task to another operator, (b) Reassign the question to another operator, (c) Transfer task to a different agent team | **(a) Full transfer of human oversight — Decided.** The handler accepts `/handoff TASK-ID @operator-alias` syntax and performs a full oversight transfer: (1) validates syntax (two arguments: task ID and operator alias); (2) validates that the specified task exists and the sending operator currently has oversight; (3) validates that the target operator (`@operator-alias`) is registered via `OperatorRegistry`; (4) transfers oversight by updating the `OperatorBinding` for the task to the target operator; (5) notifies both operators — the sender receives confirmation, the target receives a handoff notification with task context; (6) persists an audit record with handoff details (task ID, source operator, target operator, timestamp, `CorrelationId`); (7) returns error for invalid task ID, unregistered target operator, or missing arguments with usage help. This aligns with architecture.md §5.5 (lines 486–498: full transfer with validation, notification, and audit) and implementation-plan.md Stage 3.2 (line 207: `HandoffCommandHandler` performs full transfer). | Decided |

---

## 8  Acceptance Criteria Traceability

| Story AC | Spec Coverage |
|----------|--------------|
| Human sends `/ask build release notes for Solution12` → swarm creates work item | S-2 (command handling), S-5 (identity mapping), HC-9 (correlation ID) |
| Agent asks blocking question → Telegram user answers from mobile | S-3 (question rendering with `AgentQuestion.DefaultAction` denormalized to `PendingQuestionRecord.DefaultActionId` per architecture.md §3.1), S-4 (decision events), S-11 (inline buttons). Question timeout/default action: the shared `AgentQuestion` carries a nullable `DefaultAction` property (HC-3, aligned with architecture.md §3.1 lines 168, 180); the Telegram connector denormalizes it into `PendingQuestionRecord.DefaultActionId` at render time; `QuestionTimeoutService` reads this field at expiry to apply the default or emit `__timeout__`. |
| Approval/rejection buttons → strongly typed agent events | S-4 (`HumanDecisionEvent`), R-3 mitigation (callback data) |
| Duplicate webhook → no double execution | S-7 (idempotency), HC-8, R-7 |
| Telegram send failure → retry then dead-letter with alert | S-6 (durable outbound queue), R-1 (rate-limit handling) |
| All messages include trace/correlation ID | HC-9, S-9 (audit), S-10 (observability) |

## 10  Sibling Document Alignment Notes

The following items were identified as cross-document alignment points during iteration reviews. This tech-spec has been updated to align with the current state of sibling documents:

| Item | This spec | architecture.md | implementation-plan.md | e2e-scenarios.md | Resolution |
|------|-----------|-----------------|----------------------|-----------------|------------|
| `/handoff` semantics (D-4) | Decided — full oversight transfer with validation, notification, and audit | §5.5 (lines 482–496): full transfer with validation, notification, and audit — **aligned** with this spec | Stage 3.2 (line 211): implements `HandoffCommandHandler` as a **V1 stub** — syntax validation and stub ack only; does NOT perform any transfer, does NOT resolve the target operator via `IOperatorRegistry`, does NOT update any `OperatorBinding`, and does NOT notify the target operator — **not aligned** with this spec, architecture.md §5.5, or e2e-scenarios.md. Implementation-plan.md should reconcile by upgrading the handler to perform full transfer. | Lines 359–391: "Scenario: /handoff transfers oversight to another operator" with full transfer, plus error scenarios for invalid task ID, unregistered target, and invalid syntax — **aligned** with this spec | **This spec, architecture.md, and e2e-scenarios.md are aligned on full oversight transfer.** Implementation-plan.md Stage 3.2 (line 211) is the outlier: it implements a V1 stub citing an older iteration of this spec. Implementation-plan.md should reconcile by implementing full transfer per architecture.md §5.5. |
| Rate-limit model (R-1) | 30 msg/s global, 20 msg/min per chat | 30 msg/s global, 20 msg/min per chat | Not specified numerically | N/A | **Aligned** with architecture.md. |
| Callback data format (R-3, D-3) | `QuestionId:ActionId` with `IDistributedCache` lookup for full `HumanAction` | `QuestionId:ActionId` with `IDistributedCache` lookup, cache expires at `ExpiresAt` | `QuestionId:ActionId` | N/A | **Aligned** across all docs. `ActionId` is a short key; full `HumanAction` resolved via server-side cache. |
| DefaultAction model (HC-3) | Shared `AgentQuestion` **includes** nullable `DefaultAction` (`string?`, a `HumanAction.ActionId`); Telegram connector denormalizes it into `PendingQuestionRecord.DefaultActionId` at render time for efficient timeout polling. | §3.1 (lines 166–181): shared `AgentQuestion` includes `DefaultAction` as a first-class nullable property; §3.1 (line 194): `PendingQuestionRecord.DefaultActionId` is a denormalized copy — **aligned** with this spec. | Stage 1.2 (line 36): currently states `AgentQuestion` does NOT include `DefaultAction`; however, Stage 2.4 (line 142) and Stage 3.5 (lines 261, 266) correctly treat `DefaultActionId` as denormalized from the question model — **partially inconsistent**. The Stage 1.2 property list should add `DefaultAction` to align with architecture.md §3.1. | Line 596: notes the cross-doc tension and follows the `PendingQuestionRecord.DefaultActionId` model for timeout handling — **functionally aligned** with this spec's timeout flow regardless of where `DefaultAction` originates. | **This spec aligns with architecture.md §3.1** (authoritative for shared model definitions). Implementation-plan.md Stage 1.2 property list is the outlier and should add `DefaultAction` to `AgentQuestion`. E2e-scenarios.md is functionally aligned on the timeout/default-action flow. |
| Persistence provider (D-1) | EF Core: SQLite for dev/local, PostgreSQL or SQL Server for production | EF Core; provider is a deployment decision; SQLite as V1 default (§11.3, line 629) | SQLite for dev/local; PostgreSQL or SQL Server for production (Stages 4.1, 4.3, 5.1, 5.3) | N/A | **Aligned** across all docs. SQLite for dev/local, production-grade RDBMS for scaled deployments. |
| Low-severity backpressure (HC-5) | Dead-letter under extreme backpressure (>MaxQueueDepth); delivered-or-dead-lettered contract | MaxQueueDepth=5000; priority queuing; low-severity subject to backpressure | Not specified | N/A | **Aligned** with architecture.md. Dead-lettered messages are persisted and replayable from the DLQ — consistent with the delivered-or-dead-lettered reliability contract. |
