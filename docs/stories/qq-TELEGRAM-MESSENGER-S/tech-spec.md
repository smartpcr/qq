# Technical Specification — Telegram Messenger Support

**Story:** `qq:TELEGRAM-MESSENGER-S` · 13 SP
**Status:** Draft — Iteration 4
**Last updated:** 2026-05-11

---

## 1  Problem Statement

The agent swarm (100+ autonomous agents performing planning, coding, testing, release, and incident response) currently has no human-facing communication channel. Operators need a mobile-first interface to issue commands, answer blocking agent questions, approve or reject proposed actions, and receive urgent alerts — all from a phone.

This story delivers a **Telegram Bot connector** that plugs into the Messenger Gateway architecture described in the story attachment (`.forge-attachments/agent_swarm_messenger_user_stories.md`, included in the repository worktree). The connector implements `IMessengerConnector`, speaks the Telegram Bot API over HTTPS, and integrates with the shared data model (`AgentQuestion`, `HumanAction`, `HumanDecisionEvent`).

The system must handle bursty traffic from 100+ concurrent agents without message loss, deduplicate webhook replays, and maintain a full audit trail with correlation IDs.

---

## 2  In-Scope

| # | Area | Detail |
|---|------|--------|
| S-1 | **Telegram Bot API integration** | HTTPS transport via `Telegram.Bot` NuGet package. Webhook receive in production; long-polling receive in dev/local. |
| S-2 | **Command handling** | `/start`, `/status`, `/agents`, `/ask`, `/approve`, `/reject`, `/handoff`, `/pause`, `/resume` — parsed, validated, and dispatched to the Agent Swarm Orchestrator. `/handoff TASK-ID @operator-alias` transfers human oversight of the specified task to the target operator (see D-4). |
| S-3 | **Agent-to-human questions** | Render `AgentQuestion` as Telegram messages with inline keyboard buttons for each `HumanAction`. Include context, severity, timeout, and proposed default action in the message body. |
| S-4 | **Strongly typed decision events** | Button taps and text replies are converted to `HumanDecisionEvent` and published to the orchestrator. |
| S-5 | **Operator identity mapping** | Map Telegram `chat_id` + `user_id` to an authorized operator record with tenant/workspace binding. Reject unmapped users. Applies in both 1:1 and group-chat contexts — commands in groups are attributed to the sending `user_id`, not the group `chat_id`. |
| S-6 | **Durable outbound queue** | Persistent queue (outbox pattern) with retry, exponential back-off, deduplication, and dead-letter queue for Telegram API sends. |
| S-7 | **Webhook idempotency** | Deduplicate inbound webhook deliveries by `update_id` to prevent double command execution. |
| S-8 | **Secret management** | Bot token retrieved from Azure Key Vault (or Kubernetes secret / DPAPI in dev). Token never logged or serialized to telemetry. |
| S-9 | **Audit logging** | Every human response persisted with: `message_id`, `user_id`, `agent_id`, `timestamp`, `correlation_id`. |
| S-10 | **Observability** | OpenTelemetry traces and metrics; structured logging; health-check endpoint for the connector. |
| S-11 | **Rich formatting** | Markdown message bodies, inline buttons, reply correlation, deep links where the Telegram API supports them. |

## 3  Out of Scope

| # | Item | Rationale |
|---|------|-----------|
| O-1 | Discord, Slack, Teams connectors | Separate stories (`MSG-DC-001`, `MSG-SL-001`, `MSG-MT-001`). |
| O-2 | Messenger Gateway host process | Assumed to exist as an ASP.NET Core Worker Service; this story contributes the Telegram adapter, not the host. |
| O-3 | Agent Swarm Orchestrator internals | We consume its API surface; we do not modify it. |
| O-4 | Bot registration / BotFather setup | Operational runbook, not code. Document the required steps in a companion ops guide. |
| O-5 | Group-chat moderation features | V1 supports basic group-chat operation (allowlist enforcement per `user_id`, command attribution to the sending operator, unauthorized-button rejection) as defined in e2e-scenarios.md. Full group-moderation features (thread management, role-based visibility, per-group notification preferences) are follow-on. |
| O-6 | Media attachments (images, files) | Text and inline-button interactions only in V1. |
| O-7 | Telegram Payments or inline-query mode | Not relevant to operator workflows. |
| O-8 | Custom Telegram Bot API server (tdlib) | We use the official cloud Bot API endpoint. |

---

## 4  Non-Goals

1. **Real-time streaming / WebSocket push to Telegram.** Telegram Bot API is request/response; we do not attempt to work around this.
2. **Multi-language / i18n for bot messages.** English-only for V1; localization is a future epic.
3. **Replacing the orchestrator's internal event bus.** The Telegram connector is a leaf adapter; it does not become a message broker.
4. **Mobile app beyond Telegram.** No custom app; we rely on the Telegram client.

## 5  Hard Constraints

| ID | Constraint | Source |
|----|-----------|--------|
| HC-1 | Implementation language: **C# / .NET 8+** | Epic requirement |
| HC-2 | Must implement `IMessengerConnector` from `AgentSwarm.Messaging.Abstractions` | Epic shared interface (FR-001) |
| HC-3 | Must use the shared data model: `AgentQuestion`, `HumanAction`, `HumanDecisionEvent` | Epic shared data model |
| HC-4 | P95 outbound send latency **< 2 seconds** after event is queued | Story requirement (tighter than epic's 3 s) |
| HC-5 | **Zero message loss** under burst from 100+ agents (1 000+ queued events) | Story + epic performance requirements |
| HC-6 | Bot token stored in **Key Vault or equivalent**; never logged | Story security requirement |
| HC-7 | Webhook secret validation using Telegram's `X-Telegram-Bot-Api-Secret-Token` header | Telegram Bot API best practice + story security |
| HC-8 | Idempotent inbound processing — duplicate `update_id` must not re-execute commands | Story AC-003 |
| HC-9 | All messages carry `CorrelationId`, `AgentId`, `TaskId`, `ConversationId`, `Timestamp` | Epic FR-004 |
| HC-10 | Connector must recover from restart within **30 seconds** | Epic FR-007 |
| HC-11 | NuGet dependency: prefer `Telegram.Bot`; fall back to `Telegram.BotAPI` only if Bot API surface coverage is required | Story library preference |

## 6  Identified Risks

### 6.1  Technical Risks

| ID | Risk | Likelihood | Impact | Mitigation |
|----|------|-----------|--------|------------|
| R-1 | **Telegram Bot API rate limits** — `sendMessage` is limited to ~30 msg/s globally per bot and ~20 msg/min per individual chat (per architecture.md's rate-limiter design). Under 100-agent burst, we may hit 429 errors. | High | High | Implement a dual token-bucket rate limiter in the outbound queue: one global bucket (30 msg/s) and per-chat buckets (20 msg/min). Back-off on 429 with `retry_after`. Spread alerts across operator chats when possible. |
| R-2 | **Webhook endpoint availability** — If the ASP.NET host is behind a load balancer restart or deployment, Telegram may fail to deliver updates and retry for a limited window. | Medium | Medium | Register webhook with `max_connections` tuned to replica count. Implement `/setWebhook` on startup with `drop_pending_updates=false`. For blue/green deploys, keep old pod alive until new webhook is confirmed. |
| R-3 | **Inline keyboard callback data limit** — Telegram limits `callback_data` to 64 bytes. Complex `HumanAction` payloads won't fit. | High | Medium | Encode `QuestionId:ActionId` in `callback_data` (aligned with architecture.md). `ActionId` is a short key; the full `HumanAction` payload is stored server-side in `IDistributedCache` keyed by `QuestionId:ActionId`, with entries expiring at `AgentQuestion.ExpiresAt`. On callback, the handler looks up the cache entry to resolve the chosen action. This keeps `callback_data` well within the 64-byte limit. |
| R-4 | **Long-polling ↔ webhook mode switching** — Telegram does not allow both simultaneously; switching requires calling `deleteWebhook` first. | Low | Low | Configuration-driven mode selection at startup. Guard with a startup check that calls `deleteWebhook` before starting long-polling and `setWebhook` before starting webhook mode. |
| R-5 | **Secret rotation** — If the Key Vault token is rotated while the connector is running, the bot loses API access until restart. | Medium | High | Use Key Vault SDK's `SecretClient` with `CacheControl` / periodic refresh (e.g., every 5 minutes via `IOptionsMonitor<T>` reload). |
| R-6 | **Outbox queue durability** — If the outbox is in-process only (e.g., `Channel<T>`), a process crash loses queued messages. | Medium | High | Use a durable store (database outbox table or external queue like Azure Service Bus) for the outbound queue. In-process channel serves only as a hot buffer in front of the durable store. |
| R-7 | **Update ID gap detection** — Telegram guarantees sequential `update_id` but may skip IDs. Deduplication must not treat gaps as missing messages. | Low | Medium | Deduplicate by storing processed `update_id` values in a sliding window (e.g., last 10 000 IDs) rather than relying on strict sequence. |

### 6.2  Operational Risks

| ID | Risk | Likelihood | Impact | Mitigation |
|----|------|-----------|--------|------------|
| R-8 | **Operator loses phone / Telegram account compromised** — Attacker could issue `/approve` commands. | Low | Critical | Allowlist validation is necessary but not sufficient. Add optional 2FA challenge for high-severity approvals (e.g., require a confirmation code from a second channel). Log all commands with full audit trail for forensic review. |
| R-9 | **Telegram platform outage** — Extended downtime prevents operators from responding to blocking questions. | Low | High | `AgentQuestion.ExpiresAt` triggers the proposed default action if no human response is received. Alert operators via a secondary channel (email / PagerDuty) if Telegram send fails after all retries. |
| R-10 | **Regulatory / data-residency** — Telegram servers are outside the operator's jurisdiction; message content may include sensitive project names. | Medium | Medium | Do not send source code or secrets in Telegram messages. Limit message content to task summaries, question text, and action labels. Document data-classification policy for Telegram message content. |

### 6.3  Dependency Risks

| ID | Risk | Likelihood | Impact | Mitigation |
|----|------|-----------|--------|------------|
| R-11 | **`Telegram.Bot` NuGet package breaking changes** — Major version bumps have historically changed the API surface significantly. | Medium | Medium | Pin to a specific major version in the `.csproj`. Wrap all Telegram SDK calls behind an internal `ITelegramClientWrapper` so upgrades are localized. |
| R-12 | **Shared abstractions not yet stable** — `IMessengerConnector` and the shared data model may evolve as Discord/Slack/Teams stories proceed in parallel. | High | Medium | Code against the interface as defined in the epic attachment. Flag any required interface changes as cross-story coordination items in the iteration summary. |

## 7  Key Decisions Required

| # | Decision | Options | Recommendation | Status |
|---|----------|---------|----------------|--------|
| D-1 | Durable outbox backing store | (a) Database table (EF Core), (b) Azure Service Bus, (c) In-process only | **(a) Database table via EF Core** — no external queue dependency. SQLite for dev/local environments; PostgreSQL or SQL Server for production (the specific provider is a deployment decision, consistent with architecture.md). The outbox table will be defined in the `AgentSwarm.Messaging.Persistence` project recommended by the epic solution structure (to be created as part of implementation). | Proposed |
| D-2 | Deduplication store for `update_id` | (a) In-memory concurrent dictionary with TTL, (b) Database table, (c) Redis | **(a) In-memory** for single-instance dev, **(b) Database** for multi-instance prod. Configuration-driven. | Proposed |
| D-3 | Callback data encoding for inline buttons | (a) Direct `QuestionId:ActionId` in `callback_data` with server-side `HumanAction` lookup, (b) Full payload encoding in `callback_data` | **(a) `QuestionId:ActionId` with `IDistributedCache` lookup** — aligned with architecture.md. `ActionId` is a short key; the full `HumanAction` is stored server-side in `IDistributedCache` keyed by `QuestionId:ActionId`, written when the inline keyboard is built and expiring at `AgentQuestion.ExpiresAt`. This keeps `callback_data` well within Telegram's 64-byte limit. | Decided |
| D-4 | `/handoff` command semantics | (a) Transfer human oversight of a task to another operator, (b) Reassign the question to another operator, (c) Transfer task to a different agent team | **(a) Transfer human oversight of a task to another operator.** The handler accepts `/handoff TASK-ID @operator-alias`, validates both arguments, updates the `OperatorRegistry` binding, and notifies both parties. Aligned with e2e-scenarios.md (which defines full handoff scenarios including validation) and implementation-plan.md (which specifies `HandoffCommandHandler` with this semantic). architecture.md still describes the policy as pending; it should align in its next iteration. | Decided |

## 10  Sibling Document Alignment Notes

The following items were identified as cross-document alignment points during iteration reviews. This tech-spec has been updated to align with the current state of sibling documents:

| Item | This spec | architecture.md | implementation-plan.md | e2e-scenarios.md | Resolution |
|------|-----------|-----------------|----------------------|-----------------|------------|
| `/handoff` semantics (D-4) | Decided: transfer human oversight of a task to another operator | "pending clarification" — syntax validated, stub response | `HandoffCommandHandler` transfers human oversight, logs for replay if downstream API unavailable | Full scenarios defined: transfer with confirmations, invalid task/operator rejection | **Decided** — e2e-scenarios.md and implementation-plan.md define the semantic as "transfer human oversight." architecture.md should align in its next iteration to remove "pending." |
| Rate-limit model (R-1) | 30 msg/s global, 20 msg/min per chat | 30 msg/s global, 20 msg/min per chat | Not specified numerically | N/A | **Aligned** with architecture.md. |
| Callback data format (R-3, D-3) | `QuestionId:ActionId` with `IDistributedCache` lookup for full `HumanAction` | `QuestionId:ActionId` with `IDistributedCache` lookup, cache expires at `ExpiresAt` | `QuestionId:ActionId` | N/A | **Aligned** across all docs. `ActionId` is a short key; full `HumanAction` resolved via server-side cache. |
| Persistence provider (D-1) | EF Core; SQLite for dev, PostgreSQL/SQL Server for prod | PostgreSQL or SQL Server via EF Core (deployment decision) | SQLite for all environments (outbox, dead-letter, audit, pending questions) | N/A | **Partial alignment.** This spec and architecture.md agree SQLite is dev/local only; implementation-plan.md currently specifies SQLite for production persistence as well. Implementation-plan.md should clarify in its next iteration that SQLite is the dev/local provider and production uses PostgreSQL or SQL Server, consistent with architecture.md's deployment-decision framing. |
